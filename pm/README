pm/rtl8191

I've got an IOGear a/b/n wireless usb adapter that uses the Realtek
RTL8191s chipset. Works out of the box with the 3.0.0-12 kernel, but
does not respond after a resume from suspend or hibernate.

This script goes in the /etc/pm/sleep directory. It unloads and
reloads the appropriate kernel module to make the network come online
again.
