#  Purpose     :  Trustfiles are an experimental feature and can be used
#                 to build "whitelists" (versus the usual "blacklists"
#                 techniques).

#                      Sample Trustfile for Privoxy

# For this file to have any effect, the line in the main config file beginning
# with "trustfile" must be uncommented, with the name of this file following the
# word "trustfile".

# Trustfiles are an experimental feature used for building "whitelists"
# of "trusted" sites (versus the usual "blacklists" technique). For more
# detail, see http://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/config.html#TRUSTFILE.

# List trusted domains here. The default is to block any URL that is NOT
# referenced. Access to trusted domains includes all paths within that
# domain.

# Preceding a domain with a '+' character will designate that domain
# as a "trusted referrer", meaning any requests whose HTTP "Referer" headers
# contain an URL from that domain will be allowed, and the previously untrusted
# host will be dynamically added to this file. Thus, this builds a "white-list"
# of hosts the user is allowed to visit.

# Note this means that the file will grow with use!

# Also note that you can only trust referrers if you control the user's
# system and make sure that there are no programs available that allow
# to set arbitrary headers.

# Preceding the domain with '~' character allows access to that domain only
# (including all paths within that domain), but does not allow access to links
# to other, outside domains. Sites that are added dynamically by trusted
# referrers will include the '~' character, and thus do not become trusted
# referrers themselves.

# Example: to allow example.com and to white-list domains that appear to
# be reached through links from example.com, uncomment this line:

# +example.com

# The next two lines make sure that the user can access Privoxy's
# CGI pages, without automatically trusting their links.
