This is a collection of small tweaks to make Ubuntu 11.10 work better
for my purposes.

pm/rtl8191

I've got an IOGear a/b/n wireless usb adapter that uses the Realtek
RTL8191s chipset. Works out of the box with the 3.0.0-12 kernel, but
does not respond after a resume from suspend or hibernate.

This script goes in the /etc/pm/sleep directory. It unloads and
reloads the appropriate kernel module to make the network come online
again.

unity

Unity has issues. I'm building a system for the kids, trying to reduce
the complexity that they see. They're untrusted users, so they don't
get to install applications. The default application lens includes
downloadable applications. This is a (very small) patch to get rid of
that.

More to come, if I figure out a couple more things. 

Grub 

This is installed on a foxconn mini itx atom motherboard with intel
i915 video which apparently has a phantom lvds display connected. If
the video kernel option is not added, then the default resolution on
the large external LCD is always mirrored 1024x768 of the virtual
panel. The settings are for /etc/default/grub.

Privoxy

This is a whitelist based web filtering setup for kids browsing
purposes. Their Firefox instances are setup to use it as a proxy, as
well as there being a UID based firewall rule as a backup. Trusted
users are allowed full access to the web.
